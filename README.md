# React PWA
A highly scalable, Progressive Web Application foundation with the best Developer Experience.

[Watch it in action: Checkout the demo](https://react-pwa.now.sh/)

##### Results
We haven't implemented CDN yet, thus a bit of variation in performance.
###### Chrome Lighthouse
![Lighthouse Performance](https://www.atyantik.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lighthouse-Performance-Report-React-PWA.png)
Don't go with image, [Check for yourself in your browser](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)
*We ommited the performance as it was just **82** (pretty good huh??). Cause of server latency. Server is located somewhere in USA and we are in India*  

###### GTMetrix

#### Features
##### Code splitting
The very difficulty faced when developing enterprise application is code splitting. We don't need everything in single JS file. Why not create individual JS files for respective module/page!
We make it really easy here to just create a page that return array of routes. Code is split and loaded automatically when the respective route is called.
*(Enabled in production mode)*  

##### Hot Reloading
Development is lot easy with hot reloading. Make changes and the code is auto/hot-reloaded in the browser.
And we have not missed "sass". Preserver application state when you update in underlying code.  

##### ES6/7 Compatible
Using babel we support the next generation JavaScript syntax including Object/Array destructuring, arrow functions, JSX syntax and more...  

##### Backed by React-Router
We are using the most accepted React router for routing the application. Add your favorite /about, /contact, /dashboard pages.  

##### Offline support
Yes your application is offline available. Run without internet. Pretty cool huh?? Well all thanks to service workers.
*(Enabled in production mode)*  

##### SSR - Server side rendering
The best way to get your application SEO-ed is enable Server side rendering i.e. Universal applications.
*(Enabled in production mode)*  

##### SEO
Our customized routes enable creating meta tags to create Twitter, Google+, Linkedin, Facebook cards. We know how important SEO is to an application.  

##### Content Folding
Show only relevant data when loading via server. Fold your content to save bytes.  


##### Page Caching
Well now you can cache a page in SSR. Pretty simple. just add cache option to route 

`{ cache: { enable: true, duration: 10000}}`
 
this helps you cache page when rendered via server. Why increase server load when page is static and cacheable! 

##### API caching
**Wait what?** Why do you need to cache API ? With service worker & cache mechanisms, even opaque response can be cached (no kidding!).  

##### Webpack ^3.6
We support the latest webpack for best output.  

##### Pre-loading
Preloading for non-html browsers. Yes we give a damn about old browsers.  

##### PWA support (Manifest.json)
Automatic generation of manifest.json. Lets make sure, we look good when someone adds us to home-screen.  
  

##### WebP Support 
Make your application super fast with WebP support. Read more about it at
[https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/)  

##### Image optimizations
Optimize your images when you create a build. this does slow the build process, but is totally worth it when your site loads fast. We are using imagemin plugins to optimize 
SVG, JPEG, GIF & PNG  

##### PWA - SrcSet Loader (Progressive Image Loading)
Load appropriate srcset and make your site load fast for different view-port devices. We support srcset with WebP out of the box.  

##### HSTS Supported
Enable HSTS for secure sites. Options to define maxAge and preload of HSTS. All with very simple configuration.

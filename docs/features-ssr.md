## What is Server Side Rendering - SSR ?

The most common use case for server-side rendering is to handle the initial render when a user 
(or search engine crawler) first requests our app. When the server receives the request, it 
renders the required component(s) into an HTML string, and then sends it as a response to the client. 
From that point on, the client takes over rendering duties.

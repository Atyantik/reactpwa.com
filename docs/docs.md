Getting started with ReactPWA is very easy. It helps you create Progressive Web Apps easily. 
PWA is not the only option given to the developer, one can develop static sites with hash routing, 
enable/disable service workers and also create a simple deployable application. 

ReactPWA is very simple but extendable boilerplate built on top of [PawJS](https://github.com/atyantik/pawjs). 
We are improving the documentation continuously and you can find helpful docs to get started below:

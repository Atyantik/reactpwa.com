## How does SEO work?

Here's how it works: The Search Engine has a crawler that goes out and gathers information about all the 
content they can find on the Internet. The crawlers bring all those 1s and 0s back to the search engine to 
build an index. That index is then fed through an algorithm that tries to match all that data with your query.

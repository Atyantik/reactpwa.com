**ReactPWA** is extendable. We have officially launched couple of plugins as mentioned below. Many other plugins are available 
that have helped many users achieve which cannot be achieved with simple boilerplate implementations.

A user can easily extend the functionality as every class in `client.js` `server.js` `webpack.js` & `routes.js` receives an instance of Tapable 
where one can tap to events to easily extend the functionality
